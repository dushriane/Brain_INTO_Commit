# Introduction
Using a sample employee dataset, we applied functions like LAG(), LEAD(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() to compare records, rank employees, identify top and earliest entries, and perform aggregations across categories. These functions are powerful tools in real-world scenarios such as tracking employee performance, analyzing sales trends, and generating detailed reports—all without losing the granularity of data.

# Question 1: Salary Comparison Using Window Functions

## QUERY

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary,
    LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary > LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN salary < LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) THEN 'LOWER'
        ELSE 'EQUAL'
    END AS compare_with_prev
FROM employees;
```
## EXPLANATION

Compare Values with Previous or Next Records

The query is using the LAG function to get the previous salary of an employee and comparing it to the salary of the current employee,
while the LEAD function just helps us get the salary of the next employee, and we can do operations on it like the ones we did on the LAG function.

## USE IN REAL WORLD
This type of query can be used in banks when checking the loan payment patterns of a customer before being given another loan.



# Question 2: Ranking Data within a Category

## QUERY

```sql
select employee_id,department,salary,
    rank() over (partition by department order by salary desc) AS rank_salary,
    dense_rank() over (partition by department order by salary desc) AS dense_rank_salary
from employees;
```
## EXPLANATION

Ranking Data within a Category

In here the RANK function works in a way that when there is a tie between two sets of data, both the data recieve the same rank and it skips the next rank and goes to the one after that as seen below,
while the DENSE_RANK is almost similar to the RANK function but the only difference is that the dense_rank even in the case of tie it will give the data same rank but it will not skip the next rank as in the rank function

## USE IN REAL WORLD
This type of query can be used in organizations when ranking employees based on a certain performance, whether sales or otherwise



# Question 3: Identifying Top Records

## QUERY

```sql
with ranked as (
    select employee_id, name, department, salary,
           rank() over (partition by department order by salary desc) AS rnk
    from employees
)
select * from ranked where rnk <= 3;
```
## EXPLANATION

 Identifying Top Records

We created a common table expression named ranked, and from there, we used the RANK() window function to get the ranks of all the members in their respective departments, and outside of the CTE, we gave a small condition of returning just the top 3 performers from these departments
![top 3 earners in each department](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02518bb6-2419-4d1b-87ac-b129fcb53566)


## USE IN REAL WORLD
This type of query can be used in organizations such as sports organizations to see the top earners in your sports organization or any organization



### NOTE: In the results below, 4 records were added to enhance the results.

# Question 4: Finding the Earliest Records

## QUERY

```sql
WITH earliest_employees AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        name,
        department,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY employee_id) AS row_num
    FROM employees
)
SELECT * 
FROM earliest_employees 
WHERE row_num <= 2;
```
## EXPLANATION

Finding the earliest records

By sorting each department by employee_id, we can retrieve the first two entries per department, representing the earliest joiners. This is useful for understanding team formation history or seniority.

## USE IN REAL WORLD
First Joiners: An HR tool that could be used to list the first 2 employees who joined each department, useful for identifying departmental pioneers or creating anniversary awards. It also applies to first customers per region, or first product purchases per user in e-commerce.



# Question 5: Aggregation with Window Functions

## QUERY

```sql
with ranked as (
    select employee_id, name, department, salary,
           rank() over (partition by department order by salary desc) AS rnk
    from employees
)
select * from ranked where rnk <= 3;
```
## EXPLANATION

 Aggregation with Window Functions

We use MAX() with PARTITION BY to find the highest salary within each department, and without PARTITION BY to find the company-wide highest salary. Unlike GROUP BY, this retains all records and allows comparisons directly in the result set.

## USE IN REAL WORLD

Salary Benchmarking: A finance report could show each employee’s salary, along with the highest salary in their department and across the entire company.
Also helps in assessing how competitive an individual's salary is within their team and globally.

## CONCLUSION

Through this assignment, we have demonstrated how Window Functions enhance query capabilities by compating across rows, ranking within categories, and performing group-based calculations - all while maintaining row-level detail. Overall, window functions empower us to extract deeper insights from datasets in a clean and efficient manner.
